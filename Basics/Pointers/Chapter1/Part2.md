# Address of Operator
The address of operator <b> &</b> , will return its operandâ€™s address. Example implementation with memory assignments is shown below.
```c
No = 1;
Val = &No;
```

***Similarly the following setup causes error: invalid conversion from 'int' to 'int*'***
```c
No = 1;
Val = No;
```

# Display pointer values
We can print out the variables to understand the data in it.

```c
int No = 1;
int *Val;
Val = &No;
printf("Address of No: %d Value: %d\n",&No, No);
printf("Address of Val: %d Value: %d\n",&Val, Val);
```

# Field Specifiers implementation in code
We can print out the variables to understand the data in it.
| Specifier | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| %x  | hexadecimal number |
| %o  | octal number |
| %p  | implementation-specific manner |
